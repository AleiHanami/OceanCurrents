##Build
use cmake to build it.

This project depends on flowing libaries:
GLEW -1.13.0
GLFW -3.1.2
GLM -0.9.7.1
assimp -3.0.1270

I add texture file, obj file and thirdparty libary to .ignore due to their large size, so you have to collect those libaries yourself in ./external/**, and use your own model&texture to feed the program.

##Then...
this project is still in progress, if you have any suggestions or questions
just post an issue or mailto:rayingecho@hotmail.com
